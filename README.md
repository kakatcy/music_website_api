## A Brief Introduction of this site
[User guide](./Intro.md)

## Run in localhost
* Clone API repo and install dependency:
  ```
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
* Clone UI repo and install dependency, configure `.env` file
  ```
  npm install

  # comment this line in .env

The streaming service might not be reliable due to the restriction of heroku, we recommend test on localhost to get better experience.
